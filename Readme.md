Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Graph Database Model using Neo4j for an e-commerce platform named ShopSmart.
The system models real-world entities such as Users, Products, Brands, Categories, and Reviews as nodes, with meaningful relationships like BOUGHT, VIEWED, RATED, and BELONGS_TO connecting them.

Through this lab, key database operations including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) are performed using Cypher queries.
Additionally, advanced analytical queries are executed to uncover insights such as top-rated products, user behavior patterns, and recommendations.

The project provides hands-on experience in graph data modeling, query optimization, and visual analysis using Neo4j Browser, enhancing understanding of how graph databases differ from traditional relational databases in representing complex, connected data.
